# Fingerprint-based-vehicle-starter-for-ev

Objective:
Developed a secure vehicle starter system for electric vehicles (EVs) using fingerprint recognition, enhancing safety and user convenience.

Core Components:

    Hardware: Fingerprint sensor module, microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/ESP32), relay module, and starter circuit for the EV.
    Software: Embedded programming for fingerprint authentication and control logic.

Functionality:

    The system authenticates the user by scanning their fingerprint.
    Upon successful authentication, it activates the relay to start the vehicle.
    Prevents unauthorized access by rejecting unmatched fingerprints.

Applications:
Enhances security for personal EVs and fleet vehicles, reducing theft risks and improving operational safety.

Key Achievements:

    Implementation of biometric technology for EV ignition.
    User-friendly, efficient, and reliable authentication system.
    Scalable solution for integration into future smart vehicle designs.
